The list CV 1 CV 2  and  Edit CV all are implemented using tableView with different approach. Each has tableview headers and footers as well where applicable.
1: CV 1 has a tableview cells with a stackview inside that contain any further chunks of it.
2: CV 2 has used cell even for chunks of a block. 
3: Edit CV has a different scenario so most of it is handled by code in 4 sections. the two last were left static as it has no use of multiple occurance. 

P.S: There is always a room for improvements. As the same functionality can be achieved with multiple otheer ways. i.e using scroll view is one of them.
Due to time shortage i have done my part and tried to complete it on time and in best possible way i can in this span of time.

i love suggetions from talented people in community reegarding my work with lots  of thanks.
